# Manual-Testing-Portfolio-DemoWebShop-
(https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

## Overview
This portfolio contains a series of test cases and bugs I found during the testing analysis of demo e-commerce website (*Demo Webshop*). This portfolio demonstrates my approach to manual testing by documenting test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects. It highlights practical skills in test planning, test execution, and defect tracking using Excel. It includes test cases for functional areas such as **registration, search, and shopping cart**. In the future, other critical areas such as **checkout** will also be added.

## Highlights
