# Manual-Testing-Portfolio-DemoWebShop-
(https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

## Overview
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical manual testing skills through structured test documentation and defect reporting.
It contains a series of test cases and bugs I found during the testing analysis of a demo e-commerce website (*Demo Webshop*). This portfolio demonstrates my approach to manual testing by documenting test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects. It highlights practical skills in test planning, test execution, and defect tracking using Excel. It includes test cases for functional areas such as **registration, search, and shopping cart**. In the future, other critical areas such as **checkout** will also be added.

Test cases were created in Excel with the following columns:

- **Comments** – Notes or observations about the test  
- **Test Case ID** – Unique identifier for each test  
- **Title** – Short descriptive name of the test  
- **User State** – State of the user or system before executing the test (e.g., Logged in or Logged out)  
- **Precondition** – Requirements or conditions before running the test  
- **Steps** – Step-by-step instructions to execute the test  
- **Expected Result** – What should happen if the feature works correctly  
- **Actual Result** – What actually happened during testing  
- **Status** – Ready to test, Pass, Fail, or Blocked/Skipped  
- **Test Environment** – Browser, OS, or other environment details
