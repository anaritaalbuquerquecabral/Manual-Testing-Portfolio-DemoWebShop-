# Manual-Testing-Portfolio-DemoWebShop
[Demo Webshop](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

## Overview
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical manual testing skills through structured test documentation and defect reporting. It contains a series of test cases and bugs I found during the testing analysis of a demo e-commerce website (Demo Webshop). It highlights practical skills in test planning, test execution, and defect tracking using **Excel**. Examples of defect management and test execution are shown in **Jira** and **Zephyr**. It includes test cases for functional areas such as **registration**, **search**, and **shopping cart**. In the future, other critical areas such as **checkout** will also be added.


## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Writing clear and comprehensive test cases
- Identifying and documenting defects
- Managing test cases and results in Excel and Zephyr
- Logging and tracking issues using Jira


## Test Cases Structure (Excel)
Test cases were created in Excel with the following columns:

- **Comments** – Notes or observations about the test  
- **Test Case ID** – Unique identifier for each test  
- **Title** – Short descriptive name of the test  
- **User State** – State of the user or system before executing the test (e.g., Logged in or Logged out)  
- **Precondition** – Requirements or conditions before running the test  
- **Steps** – Step-by-step instructions to execute the test  
- **Expected Result** – What should happen if the feature works correctly  
- **Actual Result** – What actually happened during testing  
- **Status** – Ready to test, Pass, Fail, or Blocked/Skipped  
- **Test Environment** – Browser, OS, or other environment details
